    Reference code that generates a PWM signal correctly
    Sets P1.2 and P1.7 as timer outputs to generate a PWM signal. Flashes both D2 and D6 LED

    Configuration:
      Timer: Timer0_A3
      Timer source: ACLK
      Clock source External 32.768kHz watch crystal

   /***********************************************************************************
    Allows prescaler to be dynamic to adapt to the correct frequency input, to go all the way down to 0.1 the prescaler needs to be set to 8.
    This is because the register must be set to a number larger then a 16 bit register can hold, so dividing it by 8 lets it fit. The problem with that
    is the larger values for frequency won't be properly represented (Values larger then 4096 don't work at all). To solve all of this the prescaler will be dynamic
    most of the time the prescaler will be set to 1 but if the frequency is less then 1 it will be set to 8. This allows the full range 0.1-9,999 to be represented.

Testing values of different frequency to make sure the desired range is actually working
