   /***********************************************************************************
    Allows prescaler to be dynamic to adapt to the correct frequency input, to go all the way down to 0.1 the prescaler needs to be set to 8.
    This is because the register must be set to a number larger then a 16 bit register can hold, so dividing it by 8 lets it fit. The problem with that
    is the larger values for frequency won't be properly represented (Values larger then 4096 don't work at all). To solve all of this the prescaler will be dynamic
    most of the time the prescaler will be set to 1 but if the frequency is less then 1 it will be set to 8. This allows the full range 0.1-9,999 to be represented.
